The NSF offers a ``Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation - SSE \& SSI'' grant
(\url{http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16532/nsf16532.htm}).  Work on specific software is most appropriate to the SSE grant, which typically awards \$500K over three years and is due in the spring.  SSI grants have a broader scope and typically award \$1M over five years; SSI grants are due in the fall.


The NSF awards about 25 SSE and SSI grants, in total, each year.  Up to 19 SSE awards and 10 SSI awards are allowed each year.

The success rate for ``Software Infrastructure'' proposals - both SSE and SSI - is about 20\%. 
 
These software grants generally support work that benefits
an entire field; it's rare that work focused on a single collaboration recieves
funding. To get a sense of typically-funded projects, see
