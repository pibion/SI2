\section*{Delivery Mechanism and Community Usage Metrics}
\subsection*{Elements: Improving tools based on data-description standards for gigabyte-scale data sets}

%\subsection{Deliverables}
The long-term goal of this work is to increase the accessibility of science analysis for both active researchers and science students.  There are three primary products associated with this work:
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Community data-access software that allows scientists to analyze binary data in any format. 
  \item Documentation that includes installation instructions, example analyses, and learning materials that cover the basic computing skills needed to use the software.
  \item Workshops that bring together scientists and developers.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{In Year 1}  the PI expects to meet the following metrics of community involvement:
%\subsubsection*{Year 1}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Between 15 and 20 scientists register for the Data Access workshop.  These scientists are expected to predominantly come from the nuclear physics community.  The PI expects all attendees to register after specific invitation.
  \item Between 5 and 10 scientists register projects with the Open Science Framework or similar platform to work on analysis of their data collaboratively
  \item An initial release of the improved software and the XIA library is made.  Both have basic testing coverage, are tested automatically upon commit, and have initial guidelines for contribution.
  \item An initial release of the skills documentation has been made.  Inexperienced students who try to follow the analysis tutorial are able to find answers to some of their questions but most are expected to be unable to complete the tutorial without expert assistance
  \item A roadmap for the data-access  library is published post the workshop
\end{itemize}

\textbf{In Year 2}
the PI expects to meet similar goals, but with more community support.  The PI expects one or two attendees to find out and register for the conference from someone outside the group and for most to register after specific invitation.  The PI expects more researchers to pre-register their analysis on the Open Science Framework.  It is expected that the releases of the software and documentation will improve the community-identified pain points significantly, and that there will be continued involvement in roadmap discussions during the workshop.

%\subsubsection*{Year 3}
\textbf{In Year 3}
the PI expects to see broader community support.  Most notably, it is expected that the data-access software will be cited in 2 to 5 peer-reviewed papers that present scientific results.

The PI expects that issues with the software and documentation will be relatively minor and that the ecosystem, now well-developed, will promote approximately half the scientists to pre-register their analysis before the workshop.  The PI expects that the roadmap discussion will involve multiple viable plans for the sustainability and continued maintenance of the software. 

The PI feels that permissive open-source licenses align best with the goal of broad adoption.  Because this work will only be sustainable and impactful with the broadest possible community adoption, permissive open-source licenses will be preferred wherever possible.  The PI does not anticipate spending NSF resources on closed-source software.

%Permissive open-source licenses (MIT, Apache, CC-BY 4.0) allow others to re-use the software but does not require that they grant the same license to users of their product.  This makes it easier for companies to use the software since they're not required to share the source code.

%Copyleft open-source licenses (GPL, BSD) allow others to re-use the software but requires that they make the software available under the same or similar license terms.  Copyleft licenses prioritize keeping source code freely available.
