	Abstract = {The \{ROOT\} system in an Object Oriented framework for large scale data analysis. \{ROOT\} written in C++, contains, among others, an efficient hierarchical \{OO\} database, a C++ interpreter, advanced statistical analysis (multi-dimensional histogramming, fitting, minimization, cluster finding algorithms) and visualization tools. The user interacts with \{ROOT\} via a graphical user interface, the command line or batch scripts. The command and scripting language is C++ (using the interpreter) and large scripts can be compiled and dynamically linked in. The \{OO\} database design has been optimized for parallel access (reading as well as writing) by multiple processes. },

This type of copper may show residual resistance ratios (RRR) that vary from 50 to 700 in the full soft condition. Knowledge of the exact RRR value is often essential for optimum system design. We have investigated the effect of stress, temper, and reanneal on the RRR and magnetoresistance of several hundred samples of oxygen-free copper from many sources. In this paper we describe the program and present a sampling of the results obtained to date.},

The linearity of the apparatus was explicitly demonstrated. It was found that the response of both types of scintillators with respect to electrons becomes non-linear below 0.4 MeV.
